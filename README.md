# Intrusion_Detection_Using_CICIDS2017
Intrusion Detection System (Classifier) Using CIC IDS 2017 Datasets

In this Intrusion detection system development, I have used CIC IDS 2017 datasets from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html. The dataset contains network logs in .csv format. Those csv files are created from the .pcap (wireshark format) using CICFlowMeter (https://www.unb.ca/cic/research/applications.html). 

I am currently preparing a paper on using the classifier. But if you find it useful, please cite:
